Search Image App
===============

An app that searches images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) website and displays them.
The user can search images by name.


How does it work?
================
By default, it has a list of cats on the screen and the user can use the search bar to enter a query
depending on what he wants to search. After entering his query, he will get a list of photos or images.
Then, he can select an image in the list by clicking on it. He will be redirected to the detail screen
where he will have information about the creator or owner of the image in an underlined and a clickable sentence. And
by clicking on this sentence, he will be redirected to the web page where Owner info are shown.
These screens explain the above description:

<img src="captures/s1.png" width="150" /> | <img src="captures/s2.png" width="150" /> | <img src="captures/s3.png" width="150" /> | <img src="captures/s4.png" width="150" /> | <img src="captures/s5.png" width="150" />
